# Consensus Calling and Validation of Single Nucleotide Variant Calling from Nanopore Sequencing with Deep Learning for CyclomicsSeq

This repository contains the code for my internship project performed at the UMC Utrecht. 

## Model training
The final models can be found in the folders nanopore-wgs/scripts/model_maskrefbase/model_cnn_c5_finalmodel with cnn being either cnn or dnn and c5 indicating the coverage bin of the model (c5 = 3-5X, c10 = 6-10X, c15 = 11-15X, c20 = 16-20X, c100 = 3-20X).

The files nanopore-wgs/scripts/model_maskrefbase/model_cnn_trainfinalmodel.py and nanopore-wgs/scripts/model_maskrefbase/model_cnn_trainfinalmodel.py are the scripts to train the final DNN and CNN models.

Scripts for cross-validation, tuning and testing of the DNN and CNN model can be found in the same folder. 

### Majority vote for benchmarking of model performance
The scripts to calculate the majority vote performance can be found in the folder nanopore-wgs/scripts/majority_vote_withoutrefbase

## Consensus calling for CyclomicsSeq dataset A ('clean' dataset)
Raw data: raw/CYC000025-extended-data
Create samples: nanopore-wgs/scripts/matrix/predict_cyclomics/make_matrix.sh
For each CyclomicsSeq dataset, the samples are created using the bam files in the CycasConsensus/MapQandNMFilter folder.
Predict: nanopore-wgs/scripts/cyclomics_clean_predict_maskedrefbase/predict.sh
Map: nanopore-wgs/scripts/cyclomics_clean_predict_maskedrefbase/map_score.sh
